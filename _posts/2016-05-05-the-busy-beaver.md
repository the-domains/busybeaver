So, why that name? It came up during a long and boring train ride and involved a lengthy discussion of Computers, the Radó-Funktion and Turing Machines. If you really like to know more about this stuff: take a look here:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy\_beaver][0] although the german article is much more elaborate: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleißiger\_Biber][1]  

In the end we thought it is a nice name for a company that provides services in the field of digital communication, it is friendly, it shows that work is done with diligence, it has teeth and it makes people smile.
